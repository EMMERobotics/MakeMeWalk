# Arduino and ESP32 dev guide

Arduino and ESP32 are both a microcontroller. The ESP32 is made for IoT purpose.
It has a built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth transceiver, which Arduino lacks. Both can be develop using the infamous **Arduino IDE**.

## Pre-requisites

1. Arduino IDE
2. Arduino code structure (`void setup()`, `void loop()`)
3. C++ style syntax (variable declaration/definition, if/else, logical operator, loop, etc.)

## In this folder you'll find...
All the libraries that we use on this robot in `lib`.

There are example codes provided by the libraries developer in the `example` of each library's directory.
